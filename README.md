# Sorting
The objective of this assignment is to explore sorting algorithms and benchmark for their
running times.

1- Implement three functions for three sorting algorithms: Bubble sort, InsertionSort, MergeSort and,
QuickSort.

2- Each of these algorithms accept an array of integer as input and return a sorted array.

3- All these algorithms sort the input array in descending order.

4- Your program generates four inputs:

a. A descending sorted array with 1000 elements

b. An ascending sorted array with 1000 elements

c. A randomly generated array with 1000 and 10000 elements

5- Run your algorithms for each of these four inputs, measure the running time of algorithms.

6- Report the result using a table or chart.
